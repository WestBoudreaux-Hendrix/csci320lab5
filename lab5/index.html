                        Animal Airways is dedicated to providing the best all-around experience when it comes to travel.
                        We strive to be more than a pet-friendly airline, we work towards improving every day when it comes 
                        to safety, affordability, and availablity. We have special-made high end aircrafts to accommodate your 
                        pets while also maintining the utmost security for all of our other passengers. Each plane is operated by
                        one of our first class pilots. Our guests are taken care of by our flight staff who see that the needs of 
                        each and every individual on board has their needs met. Each of our crafts is capable of seating exactly 
                        162 human passengers not including crew. We have done away with first class and business class. Each ticket 
                        costs the same amount and your animals transit is included. Between sections of seating, we have allocated space 
                        for your pets to stretch their legs and posts for you to fasten them in those locations. For safetey during takeoff and
                        landing, we ask that all large animals be put in these sections so that we may close the gate door. Smaller pets are 
                        encouraged to be kept with passengers so as to save the gated section for the larger animals. Below, you can see the 
                        general layout our planes have.

                                each relief area is equipped with a small pond, litter boxs, sand, dirt, tree, and grass.
                                After a long flight, or even a short one, you can rest easy knowing that relief is just

                        <p class="text-white-75 mb-4">Traveling is often closley tied to family. Whether you are traveling to
                            visit or going on a trip with them, family is in the mix one way or another. Pets are a part of many 
                            families, and their comfort and safety is just important as any other family members. 
                            Many airports have strict rules when it comes to bringing an animal along with you for travel.
                            On top of these rules, there are few, if any, accommodations made for animal companions. 
                            Our goal at Animal Airways is to create an environment that is safe and comfortable for all
                            parties involved. We have integrated effeciency, security, and enjoymenmt into our travel 
                            experience both in the airport and on the plane. Choose the best option to fly with all of your

                        <p class="text-white-75 mb-4">"Animal Airways started as little more than a dream.
                            As a broke college student with little direction in life, I turned to the indifferent world of RNG.
                            I got on google and went to a random noun generator. Refresh after refresh I searched for answers.
                            Then at last the three words that changed my entire life: Airport, Airplane, Animal. It struck me,
                            faster than lighting falls from the sky, what I had to do. I remember during my experiences traveling,
                            having a feeling of unease seeing pets in cages or on leashes in airports. I would often wonder how
                            the animals felt. It made me sad. Here, the almighty RNG gods had told me it was my destiny to do
                            something about that. Out of my single dorm room I began plotting how I would create such change.
                            That change came in the form of what is now Animal Airways."
